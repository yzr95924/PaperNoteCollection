[TOC]

## 1. Summary
### Motivation of this paper
- Motivation
Improved compression is needed to make WAN replication practical.
> deduplication + delta compression

It proposes a new method which not only eliminates duplicate regions of files (deduplication) but also compresses *similar* regions of files with **delta compression**.




### Method Name

### Implementation and Evaluation

## 2. Strength (Contributions of the paper)
1. New architecture:
adds *stream-informed* delta compression to already existing deduplication systems and eliminates the need for new, persistent indexes.


## 3. Weakness (Limitations of the paper)

## 4. Some Insights (Future work)
