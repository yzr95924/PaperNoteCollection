## 1. Summary

### Motivation of this paper
- Motivation
  - Data-protection approaches are considered computationally expensive.
    - data encryption and secret-sharing
  - This paper intends to present the first end-to-end comparison of state-of-art encryption-based and secret sharing data protection approaches.
    - previous evaluation results do not provide a clear picture of how these schemes compare in terms of application-perceived read and write throughput.
    - the combination of a random number generator, erasure code, and encryption algorithm
      - determine which one becomes the bottleneck

- Encrypt files at the client side
  - Key-based encryption: (provide computational security)
  - encryption is considered computational expensive.
    - require key generation and management
    - hardware accelerators 

- Secret sharing: (cloud of clouds, provide information-theoretic security)
  - combines the user's original data with redundant random data
  - the original data can only be decoded by obtaining all of the encoded pieces.
  - Without requiring maintenance of encryption keys.
  - Drawback: 
    - generate a large amount of random data.
    - incurs significant storage overhead

- information-theoretic security vs. computational security
  - information-theoretic security $>$ computational security 

- To eliminate two major bottlenecks of data protection
  - Secure RAID: computational overhead is comparable to that of erasure coding.
  - Hardware cryptographic libraries.

- Evaluate all stages of the data path:
  - Random data generation
    - true random: external noise or hardware interrupts: /dev/random
      - very slow
    - CSPRNG: whose seed must be generated by a true random generator: /dev/urandom 
  - Encoding and encryption overheads
  - Overall throughput

- Comparison 
  - Reed-Solomon (RS): only provide fault tolerance.
  - Encryption: encrypt the data with a key-based symmetric cypher and encodes the result with RS.
  - AONT-RS: hash the encrypted data, combines the result with the encryption key, and encodes the entire package with RS.
  - Shamir's secret-sharingf scheme (SS): combine security and fault tolerance in non-systemic encoding
  - Secure RAID: combine security and fault tolerance in two encoding rounds based on RS.

- Computational overhead
  - the low throughput of true random data generation precludes information-theoretical security in real system
  - the performance of AONT-RS is limited by the crytographic hash 
  - secure RAID eliminates the computational bottleneck of secret sharing.

- For End-To-End Evaluation
  - Aim: to understand the effect of the various **system-level** parameters on the bottlenecks.
    - storage and network bandwidth
  - Setting: multi-cloud (EC2), a distributed object store prototype. re-implement all schemes in Java.
  - Once storage and network bottlenecks are introduced, secret-sharing is outperformed by encryption based techniques
    - additional I/O and transfer overhead 
    - bottleneck shift

### Implementation and Evaluation

## 2. Strength (Contributions of the paper)
1. This work mentions information-theoretical security is infeasible in real system implementations
> high cost of true random data generation.

2. The bottleneck in real implementations shifts from 
> 1. computational complexity 
> 2. storage throughput (on local storage)
> 3. network bandwidth (in cloud deployments)

3. This paper also suggests that encrypting the data and dispersing the keys with an efficient secret sharing scheme is optimal for multi-cloud environments
## 3. Weakness (Limitations of the paper)

## 4. Some Insights (Future work)

1. Security issue in cloud
Majority of cloud service providers do not specify in their terms of service that data is owned by the customers, and lack security mechanisms to protect it.
> data leakage from the cloud have been recently documented.

2. drawback of the single cloud 
> vendor lock-in
> outage that a single cloud provider might suffer

3. Data encryption
AES: fixed-length string: 128 bits 
> AES-128: key size is 128 bits
> AES-256: key size is 256 bits
