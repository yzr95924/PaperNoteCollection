## 1. Summary
### Motivation of this paper
- There are few long-term studies of large backup data sets:
> most prior studies draw conclusion based on the entire data set

This work extends current studies by using a long-term workload that extends from March 2012 to November 2014.
> based on a long history, offer new valuable insights

- The characteristics of backup workloads 
Backup workloads tend to have a high churn rate, a lot of stream locality, a high demand for writing, and high redundancy.
