## 1. Summary
### Motivation of this paper
- Motivation
1. Semantically secure encryption can provide strong and efficient protection for data at rest and in transit
> but this is not sufficient since data processing systems decrypt sensitive data in memory during query processing

2. Other systems use property-preserving encryption to allow query processing on encrypted data.
> but suffers from limited querying capabilities and is prone to information leakage.
