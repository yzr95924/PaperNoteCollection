[TOC]

## 1. Summary
### Motivation of this paper
This paper intends to improve the PoW in CCS'11. It presents a secure client-side deduplication scheme, with the following advantages:
> Its scheme protects data confidentiality against both outside adversaries and honest-but-curious cloud storage server. (PoW CCS'11 trusts cloud storage server in data confidentiality)
> secure and distribution with sufficient min-entropy. (PoW CCS'11 is particular to a specific type of distribution) of input files.


Current client-side deduplication: hash-as-a-proof method. The hash value of a file has two proposes:
> 1. It is an index of file.
> 2. it treats as a "proof" that the user owns file $F$.
