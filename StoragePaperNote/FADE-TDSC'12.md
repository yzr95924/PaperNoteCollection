## 1. Summary
### Motivation of this paper
- Motivation
1. **Access control**: ensure only authorized parties can access the outsourced data on the cloud.
2. **Assured deletion**: outsourced data is permanently inaccessible to anybody (including the data owner) upon requests of deletion of data.
> achieving assured deletion is that it has to trust cloud storage providers to actually delete data, but they may be reluctant in doing so.


Need to build a system that can enforce access control and assured deletion of outsourced data on the cloud in a *fine-grained manner*.
