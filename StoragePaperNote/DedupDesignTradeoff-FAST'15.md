## 1. Summary
### Motivation of this paper
There have been many publications about data deduplication. However, it remains unclear how existing solutions make their design decisions and whether potential solutions can do better.

Although, there are some open-source deduplication platforms, none of them are capable of evaluating the parameter space of this paper. Thus, it also presents a general-purpose deduplication framework.
> for comprehersive data deduplication evaluation.
